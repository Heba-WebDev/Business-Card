# A digital business card built with react (for learning purposes) 

This is a solo project that is part of a free React course on Scrimba. A figma file was giving 
for the design and I had to make in react to practice everything I learned so far in the course.

The course is called: "Learn React for free"
and it's taught by: Bob Ziroll
